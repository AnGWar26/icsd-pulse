# Table Info
This file serves to document what data is in each table and what questions we may be able to answer with each table. Its goal is to serve as a reference sheet, so it's only needed to look at this sheet to know what data all of the tables contain, instead of individual tables. This document also includes a set of questions answerable with the table that I think would be interesting.
